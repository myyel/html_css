        This elegance is based on a uniform approach to data and procedures: All composite
        expressions can be viewed both as data and as procedures. It all depends on how objects
        are used. Procedures can be data to be combined, abstracted into other procedures, named,
        and applied.

        cheme programs are expressions. There are atomic expressions and composite expressions. Expressions are evaluated 
        by the Scheme interpreter. The evaluation process returns
        a Scheme value, which is an element in a Scheme type. The Scheme interpreter operates in
        a read-eval-print loop: It reads an expression, evaluates it, and prints the resulting value.
