        <h2>Programaming</h2>
        unctional Programming is a paradigm of programming that is most similar to evaluation of expressions in mathematics. 
        In functional programming a program is viewed as an
        expression, which is evaluated by successive applications of functions to their arguments, and
        substitution of the result for the functional expression. Its origin is in the lambda calculus
        of Church.
        The most characteristic feature of functional programming is the lack of state during a
        computation. That is, a computation is not a sequence of states, created by triggers that
        modify the states. Rather, a computation is a sequence of expressions, that result from
        the successive evaluation of sub-expressions. Computation in functional programming has
        no side-effects, because there are no variables to be assigned. That is, the only result of a
        functional computation is the computed value, and there are no additional changes that can
        take place during computation. Variables in functional programming denote values, rather
        than locations, as in other kinds of programming (imperative programming). Functional
        programming does not include a notion of variable assignment.
        We concentrate on functional programming because it is a small and powerful paradigm
        for introducing fundamental subjects and techniques in teaching programming languages.
